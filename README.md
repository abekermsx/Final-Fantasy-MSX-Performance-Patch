# Final Fantasy MSX Performance Patch
Improves the performance of Final Fantasy MSX by removing the framerate limiter and replacing some routines with optimized code.

This patch was tested with a version of the game with CRC32 checksum 4CFD3A9E, it will probably work with other versions as well.

The code can be assembled using sjasmplus ( https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus )

The patch can be applied with any patcher that supports the IPS file format, e.g. Lunar Patcher ( https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/ )
